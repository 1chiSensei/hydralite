## What Is Hydralite?

Hydralite is an open-source, next-generation project marketing and management platform that uses a platform-specific "currency" called Hydra, which enables you to build a vast community around your product using an algorithmic, promotional feed of content, as well as to conduct your software effectively with an intuitive, one-of-a-kind product management framework.

## Quick Start

Although we highly recommend reading <a href="https://github.com/hydralite/hydralite/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing.md</a>, here's the fastest way to get started.

Make sure you've installed Node.js (Web, API, landing, Discord bot), Python (automation), Rust (CLI) and/or Flutter + Dart (Mobile App) before start hacking/contributing within your local machine, especially if you use [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server)

To start both the web and api servers -

1. Navigate to the root directory and install dependencies with `yarn` (or `yarn install`)
2. Then, run an intuitive setup procedure with `yarn setup`
3. Once Setup is complete, run `yarn dev`
