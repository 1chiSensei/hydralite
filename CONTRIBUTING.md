# Contributing to HydraLite

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Coding new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Geting Started

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/hydralite/hydralite/issues)

Momentarily, We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hydralite/hydralite/issues); it's that easy!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
