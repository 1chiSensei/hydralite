# Contributing to HydraLite

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Coding new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

For now, We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Once Hydralite is out, we will migrate our project management to it.

## So, What Even is Hydralite?

In short, Hydralite is an open-source project management and discovery platform that's the first of its kind to enforce credit-based project discovery and a obtains a minimalist project management system. Hydralite is a system that steers away from typical scrum methodology and adopts a state-of-the-art, intuitive system, but throws in project discovery, tight integration, developer outsourcing, soft releases, one click code deployments, seamless crowdsourced data and feedback collection, and loads more, into the mix.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/hydralite/hydralite/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hydralite/hydralite); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- Expected behaviour
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
